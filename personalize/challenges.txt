Description: Many residential society administrations, tolls, business complexes and parking spaces in India lack an automated system for car parking and vehicle monitoring. Most of the commercial and residential places face an impending problem of illegal car/vehicle parking inside their premises. This issue is not bounded to just parking, but also adds to the security concerns inside those establishments. Though there are solutions that exist in the market, the affordability comes into question. In this regard, we would like to have an affordable solution that caters to the Indian markets Expectation: For the team choosing this topic, we expect to have a working model / infrastructure of the solution wherein, when a vehicle passes through a checkpost and the solution identifies as many features as it can regarding the situation of the vehicle. All Teams will be provided with an amount of video footage. The teams must build a fictitous database based on the vehicles appering in footage and demonstrate the problems that they are able to solve/automate in existing infrastucture. (For example, if a team is trying to solve problems of a residential complex, they might create a database of some of the vehicles appearing in the footage and list them as residents and others not registered in the database to be considered as visitors). Applicants will be provided video data through the following website link. http://mixorg.com/competitions/SIH-2020/registration Each team is supposed to download the data and annotate it according to the features they are going to build. Teams must come up with new features for monetization of their business model and must build machine learning models (for preliminary shortlisting and finals) and required mobile/web applications(for finals only) reflecting the same features . Teams are requested to share the annotations done by them on the video data and the pattern of annotation. Teams are requested to build the machine learning model and share a working code on github(privately with @chetanbansiwal or publically) Teams will be judged on the following grounds in the same order as written for the next round : 1. Accuracy of the model in performing the expected task. 2. Speed of the model in performing the expected task. 3. The precision followed during annotation of data. 4. The relevance of annotations considering the problem the team is expecting to solve with it.

Tourism in India is important for the country economy and is growing rapidly. The sector is predicted to grow at an annual rate of 6.9% to rupees 32.05 lakh crore(US$460 billion) by 2028 (9.9% of GDP). In October 2015, India medical tourism sector was estimated to be worth US$3 billion, and it is projected to grow to US$7–8 billion by 2020. In 2014, 184,298 foreign patients traveled to India to seek medical treatment.Students teams are expected to develop a context-based NLP engine to guide the tourists using MindMeld capabilities. MindMeld is a platform to power the next generation of chat and voice assistants. It is an AI platform for building conversational interfaces. Solution Expected: The requirements are to develop a WebEx Team bot capable of NLP to guide tourists. Student teams can choose any one from some of the scenarios that we have listed below. Tourism can be classified into the following sectors and provide help based on the nature of tourism. 1. Cruise Tourism - An itinerary Manager that proposes day-by-day schedule of the cruise with a complete list of attractions at each place along with the route navigation system. 2. Adventure Tourism - Since its adventures the bot must provide a tailor-made experience offering a personalized answer and suitable options based on the situations along with appropriate reminders based on the tourist spot visited. The old-fashioned concept of showcasing only India historical heritage and monuments is changing and people around the world are more interested in ecotourism where they want to see the local flora and fauna. Increasing tourism in the Sundarbans area in West Bengal is an attractive proposition. The region contains the biggest mangrove forest in the world and exotic flora and fauna and the Royal Bengal Tiger. Tech recommendation:   The Conversational AI Playbook can be integrated with Webex Teams and help tourists in the following key areas like Travel Planner – The Chatbot must act as a virtual travel agent who is able to share the suggestions based on the users travel preferences. It should be capable to check the Hotel Room Availability Recommend the right package based on tourist profile. Keep tourist informed about the details of the journey like check ins, flight /Train status etc. Route complex queries to human agents in real time (Adventure Tourism) The evaluations shall be based on the following criteria:  1. Depth and research to understand Indian Tourism Industry (Domain Knowledge) 2. Depth of understanding of Mind meld capabilities & Business model use cases.  4. Depth and understanding of technologies proposed in solution, e.g. Mindmeld & WebEx Teams bot Resources:  https://www.mindmeld.com/docs/integrations/webex_teams.html https://www.mindmeld.com/docs/blueprints/overview.html

Andaman Nicobar Islands is a place of historical as well as tourist importance. Tourism being the only prime industry in these Islands has lot of potential and opportunity and Technology can play a major role in attracting tourist to a large extent. Immersive real-life experience through technologies like Virtual Reality of the scenic extravaganza and under-water wonders of vivid flora and fauna which are displayed in the museums, would certainly give a new dimension to the tourists in realizing the beauty of these Islands. No such VR App is being used as on date for the tourist visiting Islands.

Under MGNREGA, wage payment is made to workers doing unskilled work and subsequent creation of assets. A muster roll is prepared (consisting of list of workers who are working on a particular asset/work ) and attendance is entered. Based on no of days attended/worked, the payment is released. Currently capturing of attendance is a manual process where a physical entry is made by the work supervisor and no proper attendance tracking is done. There is no checking or effective/efficient verification process involved. An intelligent attendance solution is desired to be developed (out of the box thinking will be appreciated ad not just limited to a Mobile App based solution) which is feasible, less complex in implementation, address all challenges and eliminates the gaps in current system promoting transparency and less corruption/fraudulent entries. The system developed/proposed should be fool proof, preferred automated with minimal manual intervention. Latest technological interventions (use of Advanced Analytics, BI, AI, Machine learning etc.) should be referenced for developing a state of the art solution Sample Data Required: No
